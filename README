1. What's a webtop?
It's basically a desktop on the internet. That's Ensei's goal.
For more, go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_desktop

2. Why should I care if it's in ruby/rails?
Well, if you're a developer:
    Ruby is a very easy to learn programming language.
    Rails is a very powerful web framework.
But, if you're a user, there's no real reason why.

3. Is this open source?
    Well, you can see it above you right now, can't you? Yes, it is, although at this time there is no specific license. Just please give me credit!

4. Try it!
Just run script/server (on windows: ruby script/server) then go to http://localhost:3000/
